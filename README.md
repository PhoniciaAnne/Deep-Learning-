## Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are the core of deep learning. They are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each connection has a weight that adjusts during training to minimize prediction errors.

### Structure of Neural Networks

- **Input Layer:** The initial layer that receives input data.
- **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers where computations are performed to extract features from the input data. In deep learning, there can be many hidden layers.
- **Output Layer:** The final layer that produces the output predictions.

## Key Concepts

### Feedforward Networks

These are the simplest type of neural network where connections between the nodes do not form cycles. Data moves in one direction—from input to output.

### Backpropagation

A supervised learning algorithm used for training neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, updating the weights to minimize the loss.

### Epochs, Batches, and Iterations

- **Epoch:** One complete pass through the entire training dataset.
- **Batch:** A subset of the training data passed through the network at once.
- **Iteration:** One update of the model’s parameters, typically after processing one batch.

## Popular Architectures

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Designed for processing structured grid data like images. CNNs use convolutional layers with filters to detect spatial hierarchies of features.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Specialized for sequential data, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, enabling them to maintain a 'memory' of previous inputs.

### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

A type of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, making them effective for long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### Transformers

An architecture primarily used in natural language processing. Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, leading to better performance in tasks like translation and text generation.

## Learning Algorithms

### Supervised Learning

Training models on labeled data, where the model learns to map inputs to the correct output.

### Unsupervised Learning

Training models on unlabeled data, where the model identifies patterns and structures in the input data.

### Reinforcement Learning

Training models through interactions with an environment, learning to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

- **Sigmoid:** \(\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\)
- **Tanh:** \(\text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}\)
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** \(f(x) = \max(0, x)\)
- **Leaky ReLU:** \(f(x) = \max(0.01x, x)\)

## Loss Functions

Loss functions measure the difference between the model's predictions and the actual targets.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Commonly used for regression tasks.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss:** Used for classification tasks.

## Optimization Techniques

Methods to minimize the loss function and improve model performance.

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Updates model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function.
- **Adam:** An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.

## Regularization Methods

Techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

- **Dropout:** Randomly drops neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation.
- **L2 Regularization:** Adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the squared value of the weights.

## Evaluation Metrics

Metrics to assess model performance.

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** Used for evaluating classification tasks.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Used for regression tasks.
